Description: With this package you can simulate CRNs implemented with 
    DNA. Currently there is only one approach for CRN construction with 
    DNA, but the plan is to expand this to other approachs using the CRN 
    simulator implemented in this package. This CRN simulator simply 
    converts a set of reactions into a set of diferential equations and 
    solve them with a package called deSolve.
